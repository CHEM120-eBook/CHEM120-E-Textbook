                        Deena Walker is a scientist who studies the molecular mechanism of addiction and depression. 
                        She found that mice who were raised in social isolation showed higher levels of anxiety than mice 
                        raised in groups. These mice also had different levels of the neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin 
                        than mice raised in groups.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Deena has a family history of anxiety and depression. She was able to overcome her own struggles with
                        anxiety to become a successful research scientist. Her family history inspired her research because 
                        she wanted to explore how genes vs. environment affect susceptibility to anxiety and depression.

                    <p>
                        Dopamine and serotonin both play a role in anxiety and depression, although scientists are still trying 
                        to figure out the details of how they do this. We will discuss the structures of these neurotransmitters 
                        over the next few classes. But first, we must learn about bonding and structural representations of molecules.

                        Atoms are made of a nucleus that contains protons and neutrons and orbiting around that nucleus are electrons. 
                        The nucleus is very small in volume relative to the overall volume of the atom but contains most of the atoms mass. 
                        The protons in the nucleus are positively charged, the neutrons have no charge, and the electrons have a negative charge. 
                        Atoms combine with each other by making bonds. There are many types of bonds: ionic, covalent, coordinate covalent, metallic, and more.

                        In this course we will talk a little about ionic bonding, but our major concern will be covalent bonds. 
                        We won’t really talk about other types of bonds in this course at all.This is an organic chemistry course so we will be learning about compounds made from a limited set of elements. 
                        Since organic chemistry is often defined as the chemistry of carbon compounds, carbon will be central to our studies. Other elements commonly found in organic compounds are 
                        hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and the halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine). We will also occasionally see sulfur and phosphorous.

                            These elements follow specific patterns when they make covalent bonds with each other.
                            For reasons we will understand more fully later, the elements we will be working with 
                            (except for H) want to have 8 valence electrons (electrons potentially able to make bonds). 
                            Hydrogen wants to have 2 valence electrons.

                        The atoms start with a certain number of valence electrons. 
                        The periodic table tells us (the numbers at the top of the columns) how many electrons each atom starts with. 
                        To get more electrons the atoms share with other atoms to make covalent bonds. 
                        One electron shared from each atom makes a bond between the atoms. So every covalent 
                        bond is two electrons shared between two atoms. By sharing the electrons it is like both atoms have one
                        more electron than they started with.

                        Covalent bonding is like two people sharing a drink. Sharing creates a bond between them. The same is true for atoms sharing electrons. 
                        The sharing holds the atoms together; it bonds them.

                    <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">
                        Sometimes when people share they don't share equally. Maybe one is bigger than the other so they take more. This can make the relationship less stable. 
                        The same can be said for bonds. Some atoms attract the shared electrons more than others. Usually this makes for bonds that are more reactive.

                        We could take this analogy further. If the one of the people is much larger than the other they could take the drink entirely for themselves. 
                        This can actually make a strong bond too since the smaller person will be after the larger one to try to get some of the drink too. This is like an ionic bond.

                            It is possible for two atoms to share more electrons with each other, always in pairs. 
                            We will see single bonds (1 electron shared from each atom), double bonds (2 electrons 
                            shared from each atom for 4 total), and triple bonds (3 electrons shared from each atom 
                            for 6 total). Since for every bond the atom gets an extra electron and each atom wants to 
                            get a total of 8 valence electrons, the number of bonds each atom makes is 8 minus the number of 
                            valence electrons it starts with (from the periodic table). Hydrogen makes 1 bond.

                        Lewis dot symbols are written by writing the symbol (letter) for each atom then surrounding 
                        it with dots to represent electrons. Imagine the symbol is inside a square. We write up to 
                        two electrons on each side of the square but start with one electron per side and only pair 
                        them up when we have more than 4 valence electrons. The dot structures show us how we can connect 
                        atoms to make molecules. Every where we have a single electron on a side we can make a bond to another 
                        atom. When all the atoms have all their single electrons used up the molecule is complete. Usually we 
                        represent a bond with a line between the two  atoms. A line represents a bond, which is a sharing of two electrons. On
                        sides where there are two electrons we don’t make a bond. Those electrons are not shared. 
                        Sometimes they are referred to as non-bonding electrons or as “lone pairs.”

                    <p><strong>Representing structures</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        There are multiple ways that chemists represent a molecule. We saw the Lewis dot structure or Lewis Structure 
                        (with lines for bonds). Of course, we can also just write a molecular formula. The molecular formula simply 
                        lists the types of atoms present and the number of each kind of atom. We always list the atoms in the order 
                        of C then H then any other atoms in alphabetical order. This is because all organic molecules contain C and 
                        almost all contain H, but they don’t necessarily have other elements and usually fewer of them. The molecular 
                        formula contains less information than the Lewis structure. It tells us how many of each kind of atom but not 
                        how they are connected. It has the advantage of being easier to write and 
                        is useful for things like stoichiometry, but not very useful for understanding physical and chemical properties of the compound.                    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Lewis Structure tells us a lot about how the molecule is put together, but when we start working with larger 
                        molecules, let's say with 8 or more carbon atoms, it becomes cumbersome to write out every atom and every bond. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So chemists have developed ways of writing less while still representing how the atoms are connected. One of 
                        these ways is the condensed structure.

                    <p>
                        None of these ways of representing the molecule (molecular formula, Lewis structure, condensed structure) are completely 
                        accurate representations. While the Lewis and condensed structures show us how the atoms are connected, they don’t 
                        adequately represent the three-dimensional nature of the molecules, as we saw in the video. One of the skills we need to 
                        develop is translating between the actual three dimensional molecule and the two-dimensional representations we are forced 
                        to use because of the nature of the paper, computer screens, white boards, and other media we use to communicate. We will 
                        want to use videos like this along with other 3D representations to help us learn to make this 3D to 2D connection. You 
                        should also use your model kit to help with this. Ultimately, we want to be able to see the 2D representation but have a 
                        mental image of the 3D molecule. Understanding the 3D nature of these molecules is important for fully understanding their chemistry.
